 There was a good man called Davey Shippers, who was rather of the old school. He was 
 a prosecutor that Henry hired to be chief council for the House traditionary committee, 
 and in his summary closing speech - to the impeachment debate before the committee he 
 said, "Look, the President has now lied in a civil deposition, he's now lied to a grand 
 jury, he's lied to all his cabinet, he's lied to all his all his colleague's, to his 
 family, to the American people, blah blah blah----there's no one left to lie to". And 
 watching this, I had an earlier title for the book. And it was even in the catalogue 
 already. The publishers were furious that I'd seen this, I was watching at Miami Airport 
 on the TV, I thought - that's got to be the title. I've got it! The original title was 
 going to be Ask Not Tell Not. I had no idea until I sat down with the design people how 
 many pictures there were of Clinton looking both smug and wicked and mendacious, all at 
 the same time. But that, (looking at the book cover) is almost the perfect one, so a 
 hint of triumph here - in this one; it looks as if he really does feel 'That's eveybody 
 I don't really think that there is anyone left to lie to.' My book is addressed to all 
 the people who wanted to be lied to, and who still do... so in a way, he wins again until 
 I get to turn the title. Sydney Blumenthal is an old friend of mine, who is unfortunately 
 also an old friend of Clinton's - and great admirer of - and worker for. And alas, as he 
 said to the Senate when giving his testimony, he was one of those who was lied to, and 
 realizes now that Mr Clinton told him a false story about Monica Lewinsky and other 
 matters. Let him, (which shows what kind of a friend Mr Clinton is)---------go into the 
 Grand Jury and retell this false and defamatory story. The Grand Jury was me, and I was 
 prepared to say as much when asked by the House traditionary committee. And rather to 
 my surprise, because he certainly had'nt denied telling anyone else, but it became a 
 huge story, it was a week-long flap which I thought distracted attention from the main 
 story which was that the President had authored - effectively - a slander against a 
 former comfort woman of his for whom he had no further use. That's the kind of guy he 
 is, that's what he quite often does. And had it circulated in such a way as I thought 
 as would constitute an obstruction of justice because it was a threat to her as well as 
 him. As well as the slander of him. I know it's hard to keep all these female victims 
 in perspective isn't it? I can now tell them apart but it's an effort. Cathleen Willey, 
 the week before I had my lunch with Sydney - had gone on Sixty Minutes and said that 
 she'd been the recipient of unwelcome attentions from the President........I thought 
 she looked as if she was telling the truth. I have heard since that she has been 
 subjected to various kinds of intimidation of a sort of mysterious kind about it.
